# FindMDStress
#
# - Locate headers and libraries for the Molecular Dynamics Stress
#   (mdstress) library.
#
# Usage: find_package(MDStress)
#
# FindMDStress defines the following variables:
#
# MDSTRESS_FOUND          - True if both headers and libraries were located
# MDSTRESS_INCLUDE_DIRS   - Where to find mdstress headers
# MDSTRESS_LIBRARIES      - Libraries to link with to enable mdstress usage
